## 1. What is Git?

So, what is Git in a nutshell?
This is an important section to absorb, because if you understand what 
Git is and the fundamentals of how it works, then using Git effectively 
will probably be much easier for you.
As you learn Git, try to clear your mind of the things you may know 
about other VCSs, such as CVS, Subversion or Perforce — doing so will 
help you avoid subtle confusion when using the tool.
Even though Git’s user interface is fairly similar to these other VCSs, 
Git stores and thinks about information in a very different way, and 
understanding these differences will help you avoid becoming confused 
while using it.
